2. Remote control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After all settings have been made, the data transfer can be started.

Press < Space > and < Enter > on the keyboard.
This sets the instrument to remote control mode, indicated on the front panel
by the RM-LED on condition.
From now on, each command can be input by the keyboard, i.e. < vers? >.

Example: 
Activate channel II and simultaneously set the channel II attenuator to 
5mV/div.

Execution:
Input < ch2= >, press and hold  "Alt Gr" key and input the number < 018 >.
After releasing the "Alt Gr" key, the instrument is set. The return code is
displayed after the transmitted command.

The value 0 ("Alt Gr" < 000 >) will not be transmitted.
